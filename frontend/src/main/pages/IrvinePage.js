          <b>Irvine, California</b> is a city in Orange County, California.
          To the east, Orange County Great Park features an antique carousel and
          a giant, anchored helium balloon. Visitors can ride the balloon up for
          aerial views. Trails wind past ancient sycamore trees in Bommer Canyon.
