          <b>Sacramento</b> is the capital city of the state of California and largest city of Sacramento County. Sacramento has a rich and vibrant history which goes back to 1839 when John Sutter arrived on the shore near the confluence of the American and Sacramento River. When gold was discovered in the nearby foothills at a sawmill in 1848, the proximity to the river transformed the Sutter’s Fort community into a trading and mining epicenter of what was later called the ‘Gold Rush’.
